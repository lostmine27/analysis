## ① Balance changes of Steem Inc.'s major accounts, 2018 YTD
<br>

Currently Steem Inc.'s key account balance is as follows. I excluded other minor accounts.

What is important is how much these numbers have changed from the end of last year.

To find out, I looked through all of the major accounts' 2018 transfers and then compared them to their current balance.

The annual changes in major accounts are shown in the table above. There have been a lot of changes.

## ② Significant changes to key account balances
<br>

The @steemit account had a reduction of about twenty-fifty million (steem + sp)

Where did the reduced amount go?

![2.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmQFn1nbYdzPyt3aeQ8RB8SW7z4WgxJqcPB5e593WJwM5H)
*<Source : steemsql, unit : 10K>*

As you can see in the chart above, about 11.5 million were added to the @misterdelegation account.

@misterdelegation is an account that helps grow the business by delegating SP to the main dapp of the steem block chain. It is an account that can be considered a kind of Steem Strategy Chief.

@dtube, @steemhunt and many others are growing with SP delegation of @misterdelegation.

Approximately 4.14 million have been moved to the @steem account. The steem account has used SP to create accounts for many new members and to lease a few SP to make those accounts active.

In addition, the @steemit2, @steemit3, @alpha, and @val-b accounts have decreased by about 1.54 million, which is a minor change but not an important part.

These accounts are, in the end, because they have a temporary account to manage Steem Inc's funds.

## ③ Weight of balance left out of Steem Inc.
<br>

By the way, it is a bit strange.

Approximately twenty-fifty million disappeared from the @steemit account, but only about 14 million were returned, even though all the other major account changes were merged.

Where have the 11 million deficient ones gone? Yes, it is out of control by Steem Inc.

*<Source : steemsql, unit : 10K>*

It is estimated that about 11 million units were spent on Steem Inc.'s operating funds.

Maybe some are still in the exchange (like bittrex).

*<Source : steemsql, unit : 10K>*

About 85% of the 11 million leaked from the Steem Inc. left the @alpha account.

*<Source : steemsql, unit : 10K>*

As a result, in 2018, about 56% of the approximately 25 million declines in the @steemit account are used for the growth of the steem ecosystem, and 44% can be considered to have flowed out of the Steem Inc.

Most of those 44% would have been transferred to ordinary steemians, or some will remain in the exchange.

## ④ Change in balance of @ned account, CEO of Steem Inc
<br>

The CEO of Steem Inc., the @ned account, has also leaked about 1.95 million.

*<Source : steemsql, unit : 10K>*

If the @ned account is also seen as the core account of Steem Inc., Steem Inc.'s major accounts have substantially reduced balance from $ 25.06 million to $ 27.02 million.

## Conclusion
<br>

Approximately 52% of them were used inside steem ecosystem, and about 48% of them could be leaked out of the Steem Inc.

More precisely, Most of those 48% would have been transferred to ordinary steemians, or some will remain in the exchange.

I think that Steem Inc's stake is slightly reduced, and it seems that there are both advantages and disadvantages.

In the decentralization philosophy, there is also a positive element in the long run to reduce the Foundation's influence.

However, there are concerns about the need to add a new core point, and in the short term, outflows to the Steem Foundation may be a negative burden for the supply and demand of steem.

I hope this analysis has helped you a little, and I wish the steem blockchain to continue to grow.

Thank you.
